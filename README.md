## What (or who) is Morandi?
**Morandi is a multi-functional and modular discord bot.**
I am working towards making it a multi-talented bot that can help you with almost anything.
This project is based on the idea [this repository](https://github.com/fabiancdng/Morandi) I created a few years ago. I thought it'd be nice to pick it up but change some of its core ideas and make it more of an 'allrounder' as well as implementing a webinterface for (almost) all controls.

## Features
### **[WIP]** Web interface / Web dashboard
* Configuration of the bot is made thorugh a web interface instead of a 'config' commands or something
* Leadberboard of the XP and level system
### XP and leveling system
* A customizable amount of XP is given to a user every minute they chat.
* With a certain (with each level increasing) amount of XP the user levels up.
* **[WIP]** Role rewards for specific levels
* **[WIP]** rank - command for getting a user's XP and level count as well as their position on the leaderboard
### Other useful commands like:
* **clear [amount of messages]** - deletes messages in a channel
* **ping** - checks the bot's latency
