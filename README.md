## What is Morandi?
**Morandi is a multi-functional discord bot with a web dashboard.**
I'm working towards making it a multi-talented bot that can help you with almost anything.
This project is based on the idea [this repository](https://github.com/fabiancdng/Morandi) I created a few years ago. I thought it'd be nice to do a rewrite of it but change some of its core ideas and make it more of an 'all-rounder' as well as implementing a web dashboard for (almost) all controls.

## Features
### Multi-server support
Morandi can be used in unlimited servers concurrently.

### Web dashboard

* Configuration of the bot is made using a web interface instead of a 'config' command or something
* Leadberboard of the XP and level system

### XP and leveling system
* A customizable amount of XP is given to a user every minute they chat.
* With a certain (with each level increasing) amount of XP the user levels up.
* Role rewards for specific levels
* rank - command for getting a user's XP and level count as well as their position on the leaderboard
### Other useful commands like:
* **clear [amount of messages]** - deletes messages in a channel
* **ping** - checks the bot's latency

## How to set up Morandi
Morandi hasn't reached its first stable release yet.

Hence, _**I do not recommend using Morandi in a genuine guild yet!**_

**You can host your own instance of Morandi by following the [self-hosting guide](https://github.com/fabiancdng/Morandi-R/wiki/Self-hosting).**
